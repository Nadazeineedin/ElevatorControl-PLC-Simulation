# Automated Elevator System with Allen-Bradley PLC and LogixPro Simulation üõ†Ô∏èüè¢

## Project Overview

Welcome to our Automated Elevator System project! Here, we dive into the world of elevators using Allen-Bradley PLC and LogixPro simulation. üöÄ We aim to showcase the power of mechatronics engineering in designing and controlling complex systems like elevators.

## Key Features

- **Control System:** The elevator system is governed by robust PLC logic implemented using Allen-Bradley hardware.
- **Simulation:** LogixPro's I/O Simulator screen is utilized for system design, testing, and simulation, providing a realistic environment.
- **I/O Assignment:** Precise mapping of sensors, buttons, and indicators to PLC inputs and outputs ensures smooth operation.

## Elevator System Rules

1. **Priority Handling:** Elevator movements prioritize floors based on the larger number of floor orders, ensuring efficient service.
2. **Door Control:** Elevator doors open only when the elevator is safely stopped, enhancing passenger safety.
3. **Floor Limitations:** The elevator adheres to specific rules when reaching the topmost or bottommost floors.

## Code Structure

Our code is structured into six main parts, each representing a vital aspect of the elevator system's functionality. This design ensures that our system operates smoothly and follows the specified rules.

## Design Components

- **External Panel:** Users can order the elevator from outside, with floor priority rules guiding the elevator's movements.
- **Internal Panel:** Passengers inside the elevator can select their desired floor for smooth travel.
- **Lamp Control:** Lamps indicate the current floor, enhancing user experience and navigation.

## Conclusion

Through this project, we demonstrate the synergy between Allen-Bradley PLC technology and LogixPro simulation, highlighting the capabilities of mechatronics engineering in designing and managing advanced systems like elevators. Join us as we explore the intricacies of automated elevator systems! üèóÔ∏èüí°
